            <li>1/2lb clams</li>
            <li>1/2lb mussels</li>
            <li>1/2lb andouille sausage</li>

            <li>1 lemon</li>
            <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Old Bay</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Pot: Fill a large pot with 4 cups of water, add the quartered lemon, smashed garlic, quartered
                onion, bay leaves, and seafood seasoning. If you’re using beer, add it now. Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
            <li>Cook Potatoes and Corn: Add the potatoes to the boiling pot. Let them cook for about 8-10 minutes. Then, add the
                corn and cook for another 5 minutes until the potatoes are tender.</li>
            <li>Add Seafood and Sausage: Add the clams or mussels, crab, and andouille sausage to the pot. Let them cook for
                about 5 minutes, then add the shrimp last. Continue cooking for another 3-5 minutes or until all seafood is
                cooked through (shrimp should be pink and clams/mussels opened).</li>
            <li>Check if all the seafood is properly cooked and the vegetables are tender. Once done, turn off the heat. Drain
                the contents using a colander or a strainer.</li>
            <li>Serve the drained seafood, sausage, and vegetables on a large platter. Sprinkle with a little more seafood
                seasoning and squeeze lemon juice over the top for added zest.</li>
        </ol>
